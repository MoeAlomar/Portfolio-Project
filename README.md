## üë• 1) Team Formation Overview
Our team was formed at the start of Stage 1, comprising four members with complementary skills. Since no substantial work has begun, roles are assigned on a rotational basis for learning purposes, allowing everyone to gain experience in different aspects of project management and leadership. We drew from the project's involved roles, adapting them to our team structure while noting that external Tutors will provide mentorship and feedback as needed.

- **Team Members and Roles (Rotational):** 
  - Abdulrahman (Project Manager): Oversees the project to ensure it stays on track, organizes team meetings, monitors progress, identifies risks, and ensures deadlines are met.
  - Meshari (Project Evaluator): Assesses deliverables based on rubrics, evaluates project outcomes, and provides internal feedback to simulate evaluator perspectives.
  - Abdulelah (Team Member/Team Lead): Responsible for idea generation, development, and documentation; focuses on task coordination and technical decision-making when leading.
  - Mohammad (Team Member/Tutor): Responsible for idea generation, development, and documentation; contributes to brainstorming and refining concepts, while helping us understand the technical difficulties.

- **Collaboration Strategies:** 
  - We primarily meet in person at the academy, as face-to-face interactions foster better collaboration and idea exchange.
  - For remote coordination, we use Discord for messaging or voice calls when in-person meetings aren't possible.
  - Communication: We established a dedicated Discord channel for daily async communication and scheduled bi-weekly meetings (in-person or via Discord calls) for sync-ups.
  - Documentation: All shared notes, meeting minutes, and resources are centralized in a shared Word file for easier management. Decision-making is based on consensus, with a fallback to majority vote if needed.
  - This approach ensures inclusivity, leverages our small team size for quick decisions, and prepares us for rotating roles in future stages.

## üè† 2) Selected MVP Concept ‚Äî UniStay KSA (Student Housing & Roommates)

### 2.1 Summary of the Chosen MVP
- **Problem:** After admission policies changed, students can be accepted to universities outside their home city. Many struggle to find safe, affordable accommodation quickly; listings are fragmented across Twitter, Haraj, Telegram, and street notices.
- **Solution (MVP):** A web/app platform focused on transferred students to discover rooms, shared apartments, and student-friendly hotels/serviced apartments near campuses. Students can filter by price, distance, female-only or group housing, and desired roommate setup. Owners (individuals or hotels) can list spaces and optionally provide student discounts. In-app chat enables owners and students to align on house rules and details.

**Core MVP flows (scope):**
- Discover: Campus/city search ‚Üí filters (budget, distance, room type, female-only, roommates).
- Listings: Photos, price, rules, deposit, availability, map pin, ‚Äústudent discount‚Äù tag.
- Roommates: Opt-in roommate matching (basic preferences, same campus/program optional).
- Owners: Post/Manage listing (individual landlords & partner hotels); verify via phone/email.
- Safety & Trust (v1): edu-email badge (optional), report listing, profile completeness score.
- Messaging: In-app chat to discuss terms; no in-app payments in MVP.

### 2.2 Reasons for Selection
- Lived pain & demand: Team members and peers faced this exact problem; strong user empathy and clear value.
- Feasibility in 3 months: Can start one pilot city (e.g., Riyadh/Jeddah) and seed supply via owner outreach and student communities; no complex external integrations required for MVP.
- Innovation / focus: Unlike general classifieds, student-first filters (near campus, female groups, roommate preferences, student discounts) tightly match the use case.
- Alignment with course goals: Clean data model, role-based access (student/owner/mod), geo search, safety/verification, and chat‚Äîgreat coverage of SDLC, architecture, and documentation.

### 2.3 Potential Challenges & Opportunities
**Challenges (with mitigations):**
- Supply cold-start: Hard to convince owners/hotels early.  
Mitigation: Start with a micro-pilot (one campus), outbound invites, featured ‚Äúearly partner‚Äù badges, and simple student-discount toggle for hotels to attract demand.
- Trust & safety (fraud/scams): New platform needs credibility.  
Mitigation: Optional .edu email verification badge, phone verification, report/ban tools, visible profile completeness, and clear house-rules templates.
- Affordability & coverage across KSA: Large geography; variable rents.  
Mitigation: Phase rollout (city by city), price bands and ‚Äúdistance to campus‚Äù filter, spotlight budget listings and shared rooms.
- Legal & operational clarity: Listings must comply with local housing norms/policies.  
Mitigation: Clear terms & disclaimers, content moderation, owner attestation on each listing; no payments/leases handled in-app during MVP.
- Quality of listings: Incomplete info/photos reduce conversion.  
Mitigation: Guided listing form, required key fields, photo checklist, and ‚Äúlisting quality score.‚Äù

**Opportunities:**
- University partnerships: Housing offices and student clubs for distribution and verified listings.
- Hotel/serviced apartments: Off-peak inventory with student rates; steady occupancy for partners.
- Female group housing: Dedicated category and safety features to support group stays.
- Seasonal admission peaks: Launch campaigns aligned with admission results & semester start.
- Future extensions: In-app booking/deposits, roommate matching upgrades, verified landlord program, utilities-included bundles, and relocation guides.
