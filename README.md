## üë• 1) Team Formation Overview
Our team was formed at the start of Stage 1, comprising four members with complementary skills. Since no substantial work has begun, roles are assigned on a rotational basis for learning purposes, allowing everyone to gain experience in different aspects of project management and leadership. We drew from the project's involved roles, adapting them to our team structure while noting that external Tutors will provide mentorship and feedback as needed.

- **Team Members and Roles (Rotational):** 
  - Abdulrahman (Project Manager): Oversees the project to ensure it stays on track, organizes team meetings, monitors progress, identifies risks, and ensures deadlines are met.
  - Meshari (Project Evaluator): Assesses deliverables based on rubrics, evaluates project outcomes, and provides internal feedback to simulate evaluator perspectives.
  - Abdulelah (Team Member/Team Lead): Responsible for idea generation, development, and documentation; focuses on task coordination and technical decision-making when leading.
  - Mohammad (Team Member/Tutor): Responsible for idea generation, development, and documentation; contributes to brainstorming and refining concepts, while helping us understand the technical difficulties.

- **Collaboration Strategies:** 
  - We primarily meet in person at the academy, as face-to-face interactions foster better collaboration and idea exchange.
  - For remote coordination, we use Discord for messaging or voice calls when in-person meetings aren't possible.
  - Communication: We established a dedicated Discord channel for daily async communication and scheduled bi-weekly meetings (in-person or via Discord calls) for sync-ups.
  - Documentation: All shared notes, meeting minutes, and resources are centralized in a shared Word file for easier management. Decision-making is based on consensus, with a fallback to majority vote if needed.
  - This approach ensures inclusivity, leverages our small team size for quick decisions, and prepares us for rotating roles in future stages.

## üí° 2) Ideas Explored (Rejected)
Our team brainstormed numerous concepts to identify a project that is innovative, feasible, and aligned with our learning goals. After initial discussion, we shortlisted five promising ideas for a detailed feasibility analysis. Ultimately, none were selected for progression to Stage 2. The five ideas and our rationale for rejecting them are detailed below. 

Each includes Problem, Proposed MVP, Core Features, Strengths, Weaknesses, and the Reason we did not select it for Stage 2.

### 5) üìö ExamPal ‚Äî Collaborative Study Planner
- **Description:** A web application that generates personalized study timelines based on exam dates and allows students to form study groups to coordinate topics and track progress.
- **Problem:** Students struggle to organize multi-subject study schedules and coordinate group sessions.
- **Proposed MVP:** Web app where users enter subjects and exam dates; the app generates a suggested study timeline. Groups can share a plan and assign topics.
- **Core Features:**
  - Create subjects & exam dates
  - Auto-generated visual timeline (e.g., Gantt) per subject
  - ‚ÄúStudy Group‚Äù with shareable link and shared timeline
  - Members mark topics ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù
- **Strengths:** Clear data model (Users ‚Üí Subjects ‚Üí Groups), simple scheduling algorithm, approachable UI, feasible within course timeline.
- **Weaknesses:** Crowded planner space; uncertain adoption of group study flows; limited technical depth for a 3-month showcase.
- **Reason not selected:** Scope felt too light to demonstrate richer architecture and data challenges compared with other options.
